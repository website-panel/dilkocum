        "passage": "Measuring more than five feet tall and ten feet long, the Javan rhinoceros is often called the rarest large mammal on earth. None exist in zoos. Like the Indian rhino, the Javan has only one horn; African and\nSumatran rhinos have two. While the Javan rhino habitat once\nextended across southern Asia, now there are fewer than one hundred\nof the animals in Indonesia and under a dozen in Vietnam. Very little is\nknown about Javan rhinos because they lead secretive and solitary lives\nin remote jungles. Until recently, scientists debated whether females even have horns, and most scientific work\nhas had to rely on DNA garnered from dung.\nThe near extinction of the Javan rhino is the direct result of human actions. For centuries, farmers, who favored\nthe same habitat, viewed them as crop eating pests and shot them on sight. During the colonial period, hunters\nslaughtered thousands. Now, human efforts to save them may well prove futile. The Vietnamese herd is probably\ndoomed, as too few remain to maintain the necessary genetic variation. Rhinos from Java cannot supplement the\nVietnamese numbers because in the millions of years since Indonesia separated from the mainland, the two\ngroups have evolved into separate sub-species. In Indonesia, the rhinos are protected on the Ujung Kulon\npeninsula, which is unsettled by humans, and still have sufficient genetic diversity to have a chance at survival.\nIronically, however, the lack of human disturbance allows mature forests to replace the shrubby vegetation the\nanimals prefer. Thus, human benevolence may prove little better for these rhinos than past human\nmaltreatment.",

        "passage": "For years, U.S. employers have counted on a steady flow of labor\nfrom Mexico willing to accept low-skilled, low paying jobs. These\nworkers, many of whom leave economically depressed villages in\nthe Mexican interior, are often more than willing to work for\nwages well below both the U.S. minimum wage and the poverty\nline. However, thanks to a dramatic demographic shift currently\ntaking place in Mexico, the seemingly inexhaustible supply of\nworkers migrating from Mexico to the United States might one\nday greatly diminish if not cease. Predictions of such a drastic decrease in the number of Mexican immigrants,\nboth legal and illegal, are driven by Mexico’s rapidly diminishing population growth.\nAs a result of a decades-long family planning campaign, most Mexicans are having far fewer children than was the\nnorm a generation ago. The campaign, organized around the slogan that “the small family lives better,” saw the\nMexican government establish family-planning clinics and offer free contraception. For nearly three decades, the\ngovernment’s message concerning population hasn’t wavered. In fact, the Mexican Senate recently voted to\nextend public school sex education programs to kindergarten. The result of Mexico’s efforts to stem population\ngrowth is nothing short of stunning. In 1968, the average Mexican woman had just fewer than seven children;\ntoday, the figure is slightly more than two.\nFor two primary reasons, Mexico’s new demographics could greatly impact the number of Mexicans seeking work\nin the U.S. First, smaller families by their nature limit the pool of potential migrants. Second, the slowing of\nMexico’s population growth has fostered hope that Mexico will develop a healthy middle class of people content\nto make their livelihoods in their home country. Though the former of these factors is all but assured, the growth\nof a healthy middle class is far from a foregone conclusion. The critical challenge for Mexico is what it does with\nthe next 20 years. Mexico must invest in education, job training, and infrastructure, as well as a social-security\nsystem to protect its aging population. If Mexico is willing to step forward and meet this challenge, America may\none day wake up to find that, like cheap gasoline, cheap Mexican labor has become a thing of the past.",

In\nthe mid-1950s, the Egyptian government concluded that a\nsignificant dam was necessary to enable the country’s economic\ndevelopment to be on a par with that of Western nations. The\nAswan Dam would prevent the annual flooding, generate\nhydroelectric power and supply a steady source of water for residents and agricultural activities, though it would\nalso have other, less positive effects.\nBy the 1970s, most Egyptian villages had electric power, and the dam provided approximately half of Egypt’s\nentire output of electricity. The benefits were counteracted, however, by consequences which were sometimes\nslow to appear but ruinous in their long-term effects. Dams prevent silt from flowing through to downstream\nlands. The silt is essential for renewing the minerals and nutrients that make the land fertile; before the dam, the\nNile floodplain was famously productive. Farmers have had to substitute artificial fertilizers, reducing profits and\ncausing pervasive chemical pollution with deleterious effects for the human, animal and plant populations living\nnear or in the river. It is difficult to draw definite conclusions about a project with such substantial and varied\nresults, but it would be untenable to assert that the Egyptian government should never have built the Aswan\nDam.",

        "passage": "A recent ball-catching experiment conducted in space by astronauts on\nboard a space shuttle has led neuroscientists to conclude that the brain\ncontains an internal model of gravity that is both powerful and\npersistent. At the same time, the experiment provided evidence that\nthe brain can adapt to environments in which the force of downward\nacceleration is less pronounced than it is on earth.\nThe experiment’s outcomes suggested that an individual’s understanding of motion is hard-wired from an\nearthcentric perspective. In the experiment, the astronauts were asked to catch balls released from a springloaded\ncannon. Analyzing data gathered from infrared tracking cameras and electrodes placed on the astronauts’\narms, McIntyre, the experiment’s principal designer, noticed that the astronauts’ anticipation of the ball’s motion\nwas slightly off. Though they were able to catch the ball, the astronauts expected the ball to move faster than it\ndid. He theorized that this over-anticipation is due to the fact that the brain expects the force of the earth’s\ngravity to act on the ball.\nThe experiment also demonstrates the brain’s ability to adjust to conditions that run counter to its pre-set wiring.\nWhile the astronauts did not adapt to the conditions in space for some time, by day 15 of the experiment, the\namplitude of the premature arm movements decreased and a new well-timed arm movement immediately\npreceded the catch. Upon returning to earth, the astronauts again mis-anticipated the ball’s motion, though this\ntime the ball moved faster than anticipated. However, the astronauts were able to adjust back to the earth’s\ngravitational effect on the balls much more quickly than they had been able to adapt to the conditions in space.\nMany scientists view the findings as a first step in research that could have serious practical benefits. The ability\nof astronauts to safely explore space and investigate other planets is dependent on understanding the differences\nbetween our physical reactions on earth and elsewhere. On another level, understanding timing processes in the\nbody might lead to the development of treatments for coordination problems experienced by individuals with\ncertain types of brain damage.",

        "passage": "Dogs are widely employed by the police as biological detection systems\nto detect the smuggling and storage of drugs. Yet, recent evidence\nsuggests that insects, rather than mammals, may be used more\neffectively in this capacity. One of the disadvantages of dogs lies in the\nfact that these animals, like humans, may get bored and lose interest.\nOther problems may also result from the emotional relationship\nbetween a dog and its owner. Insects, on the other hand, remain\nrelatively free of these emotional attachments and, at the same time,\npossess biological detection mechanisms that are at least as effective as those of mammals.\nInsects have olfactory systems that are very similar to those of vertebrates, detecting odors via finger-like\nprotuberances on the antenna, called olfactory sensilla. The odorant molecule passes through pores in the outer\ncuticle of the sensillum and becomes attached to an odorant binding protein. This protein carries the hydrophobic\nligand through the lymph fluid found inside the cell and attaches it to a receptor on the dendritic projections of a\nsensory nerve cell. Finally, this receptor sends a signal to the central nervous system, allowing for easy detection\nby researchers. The position of the insect olfactory organs on the surface of its body allows for direct investigation\nof the system’s response. A technique developed by German biologist Dietrich Schneider in the 1950s became the\nfirst method that enabled researchers to record the activity in insect olfactory nerves and identify the compounds\nthat trigger a behavioral response. The recent developments in this direction suggest that the detection\nmechanisms of insects are likely to be applied in practice in the near future.",

        "passage": "The movement for women’s rights traces its origin to the first half of\nthe nineteenth century. The Seneca Falls Convention, held in Seneca\nFalls, New York in July of 1848, is commonly regarded as the\nbeginning of the women's rights movement in the United States.\nThis conference was preceded by a series of ground-breaking events\nthat made possible this seminal milestone in the history of American\nwomen.\nThe idea for the convention emerged during the 1840 World Anti-\nSlavery Convention in London, a conference that precluded its female delegates from participation in discussions.\nLucretia Mott, a famous women’s rights activist, wrote in her diary that calling the 1840 convention a “world”\nconvention \"was a mere poetical license.\" She had accompanied her husband to London but had to sit behind a\npartition with other women activists, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who later became one of the main forces\nbehind the Seneca Falls Convention.\nDuring the early 1840s, Elizabeth Cady Stanton composed the Declaration of Sentiments, a document modeled\nafter the Declaration of Independence, declaring the rights of women. At the time of its composition, the\nDeclaration of Sentiments was so bold that when Elizabeth Stanton showed the draft to her husband, he stated\nthat if she read it at the Seneca Falls Convention, he would have to leave town. The Declaration contained several\nnew resolutions. It proclaimed that all men and women are born equal and stated that no man could withhold a\nwoman's rights, take her property, or preclude her from the right to vote. This Declaration also became the\nfoundation for the Seneca Falls Convention.\nOn July 19-20, 1848, the Seneca Falls Convention brought together 240 delegates between ages 22 and 60,\nincluding forty men, who spent the two days at the conference debating, refining and voting on the Declaration of\nSentiments. Most of the declaration’s resolutions received unanimous support and were officially endorsed. Later\nin 1848, the Seneca Falls convention was followed by an even larger meeting in Rochester, New York. Thereafter,\nnational women's conventions were held annually, contributing to the growing momentum in the movement for\nwomen's rights.",

        "passage": "The bond between the domestic dog and humans is such that the\ndog exists in every part of the world inhabited by people. The\nrelationship between the two species stretches back tens of\nthousands of years, to the first domestication of the wolf. Every\nmodern breed of domestic dog, of which there are more than 400\ntoday, is descended from this wild ancestor. Prehistoric humans had\ncontact with other wild canids, such as jackals, foxes, dholes, and\nAfrican hunting dogs, but only the wolf possessed the characteristics that allowed for integration into human life,\nwhich implies social assimilation, as opposed to mere domestication, which requires only a taming of wild\ninstincts in the animal. So while dogs have been integrated, animals such as cows, sheep, and goats have not.\nThe traits in the wolf that allowed for integration are threefold. First, the wolf is a highly social animal, living in\npacks, akin to the social networks of humans. In the absence of this behavior, it would have been difficult for the\nfirst captive wolf pups to remain in a human settlement, constantly surrounded by other creatures. Wild canids\nsuch as the jackal and fox are solitary animals and would not have adapted easily, if at all, to social living. Second,\nwolves possess a system of social stratification remarkably similar to that of humans: each member of the group\nis aware of its rank in the chain of dominance and is loyal to higher-ranking members. Humans exploited this\ninnate sensitivity to hierarchy by raising wolf cubs to be submissive. Third, wolves are highly intelligent creatures,\nable to learn tasks quickly. Without this attribute, the wolf would have been of little use to early man, since it\ndoes not provide meat, milk, or wool. The more intelligent the captive wolf, the more likely humans would have\nsought to breed it, resulting in perpetuation of this inborn intelligence and culminating in the remarkable\ncognitive abilities of modern dogs.\nThe development of different breeds from the wolf appears to have begun as early as 2000 B.C. in ancient Egypt\nand parts of western Asia. The first recorded instances of physically distinct breeds come from these areas. In\nEgypt, dogs resembling modern greyhounds were prevalent, while in western Asia dogs resembling modern\nmastiffs were common. The distinct body types of these breeds perhaps reflect the different purposes for which\nthey were bred: greyhounds for chasing swift prey, such as hares, and mastiffs for grappling with larger prey, such\nas boars or antelope. But this is only speculation; the historical record from this period is too sparse to allow\ncertainty on the matter.",

        "passage": "A clone is a genetically identical copy of a living organism.\nHuman clones are nothing new; they occur naturally in the\nrecognizable form of identical twins. Not until the successful\ncloning of a sheep called Dolly, however, has the possibility of\nintentionally producing an identical copy of a human been\nconsidered seriously.\nProduction of a human clone would most likely utilize the same\nbasic methodology that resulted in Dolly. A human egg would be retrieved from an individual, and its genetic\nmaterial (DNA) would be removed and replaced with DNA derived from any adult human cell type. This would\nbypass the need for fertilization of the egg by the sperm in order to obtain a full complement of DNA. In a\nlaboratory dish, the egg would then undergo several cell divisions. Placed into a uterus, the resulting embryo\nwould grow and, with luck, develop until birth.\nAlthough this cloning technique is conceptually and procedurally simple, its success rate has been extremely low.\nThe birth of one Dolly, for instance, required the preparation of 277 re-nucleated eggs, followed by the\nimplantation of 29 resulting best embryos. The low success rate can be attributed to the difference between the\nyoung DNA of a normally fertilized egg and the genetic material of the re-nucleated egg, which is mature and of\ndefined destiny – it has already committed itself to a particular physiological role. In order for proper fetal\ndevelopment to occur, mature DNA must be coaxed into reverting to its youthful state, a complex process that\nwill be difficult to achieve for the human species.\nBeyond the practical difficulties of intentional human cloning, scientists, politicians, and others have raised\nserious ethical concerns about this practice. For example, there is a chance that the cloning procedure would\nadversely affect the developing embryo. There also might be deleterious effects on the long-term health of the\nclone. Proponents of human cloning counter that human sexual reproduction is not a risk-free affair either. Even\nif human cloning could be made safe, the motivations behind producing human clones do not fall clearly on one\nside of the ethical divide. While proponents stress potentially appealing motivations – a man and a woman who\nare both carriers of a genetic disease can use cloning to assure that their child will not be afflicted with the\ndisorder – critics argue that the practice could and likely would be used for unethical ends, such as to select for\ncertain traits, such as hair/eye color or sexual orientation, for example.",

East\nGermany, while relatively successful in comparison with\nother Eastern Bloc nations, was far behind West Germany\nwith regard to the buying power of its people. It was hard to\navoid obvious comparisons such as the fact that 1 in 4 East Germans did not even have an indoor toilet. Western\nGerman authorities were therefore committed to rapid integration of the two Germanys without resorting to\nmassive controls on internal migration, external capital controls, or continuation of a large state-owned industrial\nsector.\nOther nations were already wary of a united Germany. France, a perpetual competitor, saw Germany’s size\nadvantage increase overnight. In Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\") alone, an historical size advantage of 23%\njumped to nearly 30%, with stronger growth promised when East Germany was fully integrated.\nWithin Germany, there should have been no doubt that integration would be costly. The question was whether\nthe government was up to the task. In Italy, for example, the central government has invested tremendous\nresources in promoting the economy of its under-performing Southern region. In contrast, in the United States,\nthe local population bears the burden of varying economic performance. For example, the American South is\nallowed to exist with much higher rates of poverty and lower education than the rest of the nation.\nRather than allow East Germany to fall into total disrepair, with millions fleeing to the West and a long-term\nnegative impact on national GDP growth, West German authorities decided to try to spend their way out of the\ncrisis, creating almost overnight an infrastructure in East Germany to provide a standard of living comparable to\nthat in West Germany. The goal was to take an under-performing country and raise it to “first world” standards in\nonly a few years. This goal would have been preposterous had not West Germany possessed the resources to\naccomplish the task.",

In the 1970s, Jacobs employed these\nadvances to postulate that dreams and hallucinations\nshare a common neurochemical mechanism with respect\nto the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine\nthat accounts for the observable similarities between the\ntwo states of mind. To test the theory, researchers\nattempted to elucidate the role of these transmitters in\nthe normal sleep cycle and the effect of hallucinogenic drugs on them.\nSerotonin appears important for managing sleep, mood, and appetite, among other functions, while\nnorepinephrine facilitates alertness and mental focus. Both neurotransmitters are discharged in high quantities\nonly during waking states. At the onset of sleep, the neurons that release these neurotransmitters become less\nactive, allowing the brain to enter the three non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) stages of sleep. The non-REM\nstages typically are not associated with normal dreaming, though parasomnias, such as sleepwalking and\nconfusional arousals, are most common during stage 3. When the brain is ready to enter the fourth stage, REM,\nwhich is strongly associated with dreaming, the levels of these two chemicals drop virtually to zero. The Jacobs\nhypothesis held that the absence of norepinephrine was required to enable the brain to remain asleep, while the\nabsence of serotonin was necessary to allow dreaming to occur.\nLysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, is a semi-synthetic psychedelic drug which causes significant alteration of the\nsenses, memories and awareness; at doses higher than 20 micrograms, it can have a hallucinogenic effect. LSD\nmimics serotonin well enough to be able to bind at most of the neurotransmitter’s receptor sites, largely\ninhibiting normal transmission. In addition, the drug causes the locus ceruleus, a cluster of neurons containing\nnorepinephrine, to greatly accelerate activity. If the drug stimulates norepinephrine, thereby precluding sleep,\nand inhibits serotonin, which Jacobs had postulated was a necessary condition for dreaming, then the resulting\nhallucinations could merely be “dreaming while awake.” The research thus far is promising but inconclusive;\nfuture scientific advances should allow this theory to be tested more rigorously.",

        "passage": "Despite its 1989 designation as a threatened species under the\nfederal Endangered Species Act, the desert tortoise, Gopherus\nagassizii, has declined in numbers by ninety percent since the\n1980s. Although federal protection made it illegal to harm desert\ntortoises or remove them from the wild of the southwestern North\nAmerican deserts, this measure has been insufficient to reverse the\nspecies’ decline, and further intervention is required.\nRecovery has been slow, partly due to the desert tortoise’s low reproductive potential. Females breed only after\nreaching full size at fifteen to twenty years of age, and even then may only lay eggs when adequate forage is\navailable. Although the number of eggs in each clutch varies, and each female might lay a few clutches in one\nseason, the average mature female produces only a few eggs annually. From these precious eggs, hatchlings\nemerge wearing soft shells that will harden slowly into protective armor over the next five years. The vulnerable\nyoung are entirely neglected by adult tortoises, and only five percent ultimately reach adulthood.\nPredators are blamed for most tortoise deaths; ravens, specifically, are estimated to cause more than half of the\njuvenile tortoise deaths in the Mojave Desert. Tortoise eggs and juveniles, with their delicate shells, can fall prey\nto many birds, mammals, and other reptiles. For protection from predators, as well as from desert temperature\nextremes, tortoises of all ages burrow into the earth. However, if rabbits and rodents are scarce, larger\nmammalian predators may dig tortoises out of their burrows, devouring even mature tortoises despite their\nhardened shells.\nEven with current protections from human interference, the desert tortoise faces a tough recovery, so additional\nmeasures must be taken. First, the limited habitat of desert tortoises, with soil suitable for their burrows, must be\nprotected from development. Next, urban expansion often has the unintended effect of increasing raven\npopulations, so aggressive measures to control the birds are necessary to increase desert tortoise hatchling\nsurvival rates. Finally, released captive tortoises typically perish, and can pass upper respiratory tract disease into\nthe wild population with devastating consequences.\nThough desert tortoises are well adapted to arid habitats, and adults can survive a year without access to water,\nthey rely heavily on moisture in the vegetation consumed in spring, when they surface from their hibernal\ndormancy. The loss of native plants to grazing livestock and invasive plant species, then, may lessen the tortoise’s\nresistance to pathogens, though the tortoises do also dig precipitation basins in the soil and linger near one when\nrain is impending.",

        "passage": "Sarah Meyers McGinty, in her useful book Power Talk: Using\nLanguage to Build Authority and Influence, argues that while\nthe simple lingual act of declaring power does not help a\npowerless person gain influence, well-considered linguistic\ntechniques and maneuvers do. McGinty does not dispute the\nimportance of factors such as expertise and ability in\ndetermining stature, but argues persuasively that these power\ndeterminants amount to little in a person unable to\ncommunicate effectively. Management theorists share\nMcGinty’s view that communication is essential for success and many surveys have shown that the ability to\ncommunicate effectively is the characteristic judged by managers to be most critical in determining promotability.\nMcGinty divides speech into two categories: \"language from the center\" and \"language from the edge\". In\nMcGinty's words, \"Language from the center makes a speaker sound like a leader.” McGinty suggests that not\nonly is language from the center for those in high positions of power, but it is also for those of lower ranks who\nwish to gain more power and credibility. A speaker using language from the center exhibits the following: he or\nshe directs rather than responds; he or she makes statements rather than asks questions; he or she contradicts,\nargues, and disagrees; he or she uses his or her experience persuasively; and he or she maintains an air of\nimpersonality in the workplace. McGinty suggests that the use of language from the center can alter or create a\nnew balance of power. These assertions are supported by studies that show that people accept leadership from\nthose they perceive to be experts.\nLanguage from the edge stands in stark contrast to language from the center. Language from the edge is careful,\nexploratory, and inquiring. It is inclusive, deferential, and collaborative. A speaker using language from the edge\nresponds rather than directs; asks questions; strives to make others feel heard and protected; and avoids\nargument. The main purpose of language from the center is to claim authority for a speaker, while language from\nthe edge strives to build consensus and trust. McGinty argues that true power comes from a deep understanding\nof when to use which style and the ability to use both as necessary.\nWhat distinguishes McGinty’s discussion of effective communication is her focus on communication skills as a way\nof gaining power; this contrasts with most general management theory, which focuses on communication skills as\na way of preventing misunderstandings, avoiding conflict, and fostering interpersonal relationships. McGinty,\nhowever, holds that language not only helps maintain relationships but also lends authority. According to Power\nTalk, effective communication skill “is an understanding of how situation shapes speech and how speech shapes\nsituation” and “an understanding of how speech styles and the forces that affect those styles can build your\nauthority, and enhance your credibility and impact.”",

        "passage": "Antibiotics are chemical substances that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. The success of antibiotics against\ndisease-causing bacteria is one of modern medicine’s great achievements. However, many bacteria harmful to\nhumans have developed ways to circumvent the effects of antibiotics, and many infectious diseases are now\nmuch more difficult to treat than they were just a few decades ago. Antibiotic resistance is an especially difficult\nproblem for hospitals with critically ill patients who are less able to fight off infections without the help of\nantibiotics.\nBacteria can develop antibiotic resistance because they have the ability to adapt quickly to new environmental\nconditions. Most commonly, bacteria share with each other genetic material called resistance plasmids; these\nshared plasmids, which contain the genetic code enabling antibiotic resistance, can spread throughout a bacterial\npopulation to create a strain of resistant bacteria. Less commonly, a natural mutation that enables antibiotic\nresistance takes place within the chromosome of the bacteria, and the resulting strain of bacteria can reproduce\nand become dominant via natural selection. In the absence of human involvement, however, bacteria in the wild\nrarely develop resistance to antibiotics.\nIn the United States, animals raised on industrial-scale factory farms are routinely administered low levels of\nantibiotics in their feed not as a cure for ongoing maladies, but primarily as a growth-enhancing agent to produce\nmore meat and also as a prophylactic measure to compensate for overcrowded and unsanitary conditions.\nCurrently, several antibiotics that are used in human medical treatment are administered non-therapeutically to\nhealthy livestock and poultry. Examples include tetracycline, penicillin and erythromycin. This long-term nontherapeutic\nfeeding of antibiotics to animals creates the ideal conditions for the development of antibioticresistant\nbacteria, as it kills the susceptible bacteria while leaving the resistant strains to reproduce and flourish,\nposing a great threat to human health. Europe is far ahead of the United States in the responsible use of\nantibiotics: On January 1, 2006, the European Union banned the feeding of all antibiotics to livestock for\nnontherapeutic purposes. This sweeping policy follows a 1998 ban on the non-therapeutic use of four medicallyimportant\nantibiotics on animals. The time has come for the United States to follow Europe’s lead.",

More specifically, high levels of alpha-synuclein\ndisrupt the flow of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum, the site of protein production in the cell, to the Golgi\napparatus, the component of the cell that modifies and sorts the proteins before sending them to their final\ndestinations within the cell. When the smooth transfer of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi\napparatus is interrupted, the cell dies.\nWith this in mind, researchers conducted a genetic screen in yeast cells in order to identify any gene that works to\nreverse the toxic levels of alpha-synuclein in the cell. Researchers discovered that such a gene does in fact exist,\nand have located the genetic counterpart in mammalian nerve cells, or neurons. This discovery has led to new\nhopes that drug therapy could potentially activate this gene, thereby suppressing the toxicity of alpha-synuclein in\ndopamine-producing neurons.\nWhile drug therapy to suppress alpha-synuclein has been examined in yeast, fruitflies, roundworms, and cultures\nof rat neurons, researchers are hesitant to conclude that such therapies will prove successful on human patients.\nAlpha-synuclein toxicity seems to be one cause for the death of dopamine-producing neurons in Parkinson’s\npatients, but other causes may exist. Most scientists involved with Parkinson’s research do agree, however, that\nsuch promising early results provide a basis for further testing.",

        "passage": "The fossil remains of the first flying vertebrates, the pterosaurs, have\nintrigued paleontologists for more than two centuries. How such large\ncreatures, which weighed in some cases as much as a piloted hang-glider\nand had wingspans from 8 to 12 meters, solved the problems of powered\nflight, and exactly what these creatures were—reptiles or birds—are among\nthe questions scientists have puzzled over.\nPerhaps the least controversial assertion about the pterosaurs is that they were reptiles. Their skulls, pelvises, and\nhind feet are reptilian. The anatomy of their wings suggests that they did not evolve into the class of birds. In\npterosaurs a greatly elongated fourth finger of each forelimb supported a wing-like membrane. The other fingers\nwere short and reptilian, with sharp claws. In birds the second finger is the principal strut of the wing, which\nconsists primarily of feathers. If the pterosaurs walked on all fours, the three short fingers may have been\nemployed for grasping. When a pterosaur walked or remained stationary, the fourth finger, and with it the wing,\ncould only turn upward in an extended inverted V-shape along each side of the animal’s body.\nThe pterosaurs resembled both birds and bats in their overall structure and proportions. This is not surprising\nbecause the design of any flying vertebrate is subject to aerodynamic constraints. Both the pterosaurs and the\nbirds have hollow bones, a feature that represents a savings in weight. In the birds, however, these bones are\nreinforced more massively by internal struts.\nAlthough scales typically cover reptiles, the pterosaurs probably had hairy coats. T. H. Huxley reasoned that flying\nvertebrates must have been warm-blooded because flying implies a high rate of metabolism, which in turn\nimplies a high internal temperature. Huxley speculated that a coat of hair would insulate against loss of body heat\nand might streamline the body to reduce drag in flight. The recent discovery of a pterosaur specimen covered in\nlong, dense, and relatively thick hairlike fossil material was the first clear evidence that his reasoning was correct.\nEfforts to explain how the pterosaurs became airborne have led to suggestions that they launched themselves by\njumping from cliffs, by dropping from trees, or even by rising into light winds from the crests of waves. Each\nhypothesis has its difficulties. The first wrongly assumes that the pterosaurs’ hind feet resembled a bat’s and\ncould serve as hooks by which the animal could hang in preparation for flight. The second hypothesis seems\nunlikely because large pterosaurs could not have landed in trees without damaging their wings. The third calls for\nhigh waves to channel updrafts. The wind that made such waves, however, might have been too strong for the\npterosaurs to control their flight once airborne.",

        "passage": "Between the eighth and eleventh centuries A. D., the Byzantine Empire\nstaged an almost unparalleled economic and cultural revival, a recovery that\nis all the more striking because it followed a long period of severe internal\ndecline. By the early eighth century, the empire had lost roughly two-thirds\nof the territory it had possessed in the year 600, and its remaining area was\nbeing raided by Arabs and Bulgarians, who at times threatened to take\nConstantinople and extinguish the empire altogether. The wealth of the state\nand its subjects was greatly diminished, and artistic and literary production\nhad virtually ceased. By the early eleventh century, however, the empire had\nregained almost half of its lost possessions, its new frontiers were secure,\nand its influence extended far beyond its borders. The economy had\nrecovered, the treasury was full, and art and scholarship had advanced.\nTo consider the Byzantine military, cultural, and economic advances as differentiated aspects of a single\nphenomenon is reasonable. After all, these three forms of progress have gone together in a number of states and\ncivilizations. Rome under Augustus and fifth-century Athens provide the most obvious examples in antiquity.\nMoreover, an examination of the apparent sequential connections among military, economic, and cultural forms\nof progress might help explain the dynamics of historical change.\nThe common explanation of these apparent connections in the case of Byzantium would run like this: when the\nempire had turned back enemy raids on its own territory and had begun to raid and conquer enemy territory,\nByzantine resources naturally expanded and more money became available to patronize art and literature.\nTherefore, Byzantine military achievements led to economic advances, which in turn led to cultural revival.\nNo doubt this hypothetical pattern did apply at times during the course of the recovery. Yet it is not clear that\nmilitary advances invariably came first, economic advances second, and intellectual advances third. In the 860’s\nthe Byzantine Empire began to recover from Arab incursions so that by 872 the military balance with the Abbasid\nCaliphate had been permanently altered in the empire’s favor. The beginning of the empire’s economic revival,\nhowever, can be placed between 810 and 830. Finally, the Byzantine revival of learning appears to have begun\neven earlier. A number of notable scholars and writers appeared by 788 and, by the last decade of the eighth\ncentury, a cultural revival was in full bloom, a revival that lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Thus the\ncommonly expected order of military revival followed by economic and then by cultural recovery was reversed in\nByzantium. In fact, the revival of Byzantine learning may itself have influenced the subsequent economic and\nmilitary expansion.",

        "passage": "The myth persists that in 1492 the Western Hemisphere was an\nuntamed wilderness and that it was European settlers who harnessed\nand transformed its ecosystems. But scholarship shows that forests, in\nparticular, had been altered to varying degrees well before the arrival\nof Europeans. Native populations had converted much of the forests to\nsuccessfully cultivated stands, especially by means of burning.\nNevertheless, some researchers have maintained that the extent,\nfrequency, and impact of such burning was minimal. One geographer\nclaims that climatic change could have accounted for some of the changes in forest composition; another argues\nthat burning by native populations was done only sporadically, to augment the effects of natural fires.\nHowever, a large body of evidence for the routine practice of burning exists in the geographical record. One group\nof researchers found, for example, that sedimentary charcoal accumulations in what is now the northeastern\nUnited States are greatest where known native American settlements were greatest. Other evidence shows that,\nwhile the characteristics and impact of fires set by native populations varied regionally according to population\nsize, extent of resource management techniques, and environment, all such fires had markedly different effects\non vegetation patterns than did natural fires. Controlled burning created grassy openings such as meadows and\nglades. Burning also promoted a mosaic quality to North and South American ecosystems, creating forests in\nmany different stages of ecological development. Much of the mature forestland was characterized by open,\nherbaceous undergrowth, another result of the clearing brought about by burning.\nIn North America, controlled burning created conditions favorable to berries and other fire-tolerant and sunloving\nfoods. Burning also converted mixed stands of trees to homogeneous forest, for example the longleaf,\nslash pine, and scrub oak forests of the southeastern U.S. Natural fires do account for some of this vegetation, but\nregular burning clearly extended and maintained it. Burning also influenced forest composition in the tropics,\nwhere natural fires are rare. An example is the pine-dominant forests of Nicaragua, where warm temperatures\nand heavy rainfall naturally favor mixed tropical or rain forests. While there are extensive pine forests in\nGuatemala and Mexico, these primarily grow in cooler, drier, higher elevations, regions where such vegetation is\nin large part natural and even prehuman. Today, the Nicaraguan pines occur where there has been clearing\nfollowed by regular burning, and the same is likely to have occurred in the past: such forests were present when\nEuropeans arrived and were found only in areas where native settlements were substantial; when these\nsettlements were abandoned, the land returned to mixed hardwoods. This succession is also evident elsewhere in\nsimilar low tropical elevations in the Caribbean and Mexico.",

Tests for\nsynthetic pollutants revealed that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were present in almost all animals tested.\nThe research team concluded that brevetoxin poisoning was the most likely cause of the illnesses that killed the\ndolphins. Although P. brevis is ordinarily not found along the Atlantic coast, an unusual bloom of this organism—\nsuch blooms are called “red tides” because of the reddish color imparted by the blooming algae—did occur in the\nmiddle of the affected coastline in October 1987. These researchers believe the toxin accumulated in the tissue of\nfish and then was ingested by dolphins that preyed on them. The emaciated appearance of many dolphins\nindicated that they were metabolizing their blubber reserves, thereby reducing their buoyancy and insulation\n(and adding to overall stress) as well as releasing stores of previously accumulated synthetic pollutants, such as\nPCBs, which further exacerbated their condition. The combined impact made the dolphins vulnerable to\nopportunistic bacterial infection, the ultimate cause of death.\nFor several reasons, however, this explanation is not entirely plausible. First, bottlenose dolphins and P. brevis red\ntides are both common in the Gulf of Mexico, yet no dolphin die-off of a similar magnitude has been noted there.\nSecond, dolphins began dying in June, hundreds of miles north of and some months earlier than the October red\ntide bloom. Finally, the specific effects of brevetoxin on dolphins are unknown, whereas PCB poisoning is known\nto impair functioning of the immune system and liver and to cause skin lesions; all of these problems were\nobserved in the diseased animals. An alternative hypothesis, which accounts for these facts, is that a sudden\ninflux of pollutants, perhaps from offshore dumping, triggered a cascade of disorders in animals whose systems\nwere already heavily laden with pollutants. Although brevetoxin may have been a contributing factor, the event\nthat actually precipitated the die-off was a sharp increase in the dolphins’ exposure to synthetic pollutants.",

        "passage": "To many developers of technologies that affect public health or the\nenvironment, “risk communication” means persuading the public that the\npotential risks of such technologies are small and should be ignored. Those\nwho communicate risks in this way seem to believe that lay people do not\nunderstand the actual nature of technological risk, and they can cite\nstudies asserting that, although people apparently ignore mundane\nhazards that pose significant danger, they get upset about exotic hazards that pose little chance of death or\ninjury. Because some risk communicators take this persuasive stance, many lay people see “risk communication”\nas a euphemism for brainwashing done by experts.\nSince, however, the goal of risk communication should be to enable people to make informed decisions about\ntechnological risks, a clear understanding about how the public perceives risk is needed. Lay people’s definitions\nof “risk” are more likely to reflect subjective ethical concerns than are experts’ definitions. Lay people, for\nexample, tend to perceive a small risk to children as more significant than a larger risk to consenting adults who\nbenefit from the risk-creating technology. However, if asked to rank hazards by the number of annual fatalities,\nwithout reference to ethical judgments, lay people provide quite reasonable estimates, demonstrating that they\nhave substantial knowledge about many risks. Although some studies claim to demonstrate that lay people have\ninappropriate concerns about exotic hazards, these studies often use questionable methods, such as asking lay\npeople to rank risks that are hard to compare. In contrast, a recent study showed that when lay people were\ngiven the necessary facts and time, they understood the specific risks of electromagnetic fields produced by high\nvoltage power transmission well enough to make informed decisions.\nRisk communication should therefore be based on the principle that people process new information in the\ncontext of their existing beliefs. If people know nothing about a topic, they will find messages about that topic\nincomprehensible. If they have erroneous beliefs, they are likely to misconstrue the messages. Thus,\ncommunicators need to know the nature and extent of recipients’ knowledge and beliefs in order to design\nmessages that will not be dismissed or misinterpreted. This need was demonstrated in a research project\nconcerning the public’s level of knowledge about risks posed by the presence of radon in the home. Researchers\nused open-ended interviews and questionnaires to determine what information should be included in their\nbrochure on radon. Subjects who read the researchers’ brochure performed significantly better in understanding\nradon risks than did a control group who read a brochure that was written using a different approach by a\ngovernment agency. Thus, careful preparation can help risk communicators to produce balanced material that\ntells people what they need to know to make decisions about technological risks.",

        "passage": "After thirty years of investigation into cell genetics, researchers made startling discoveries in the 1960s and early\n1970s which culminated in the development of processes, collectively known as recombinant deoxyribonucleic\nacid (rDNA) technology, for the active manipulation of a cell’s genetic code. The technology has created\nexcitement and controversy because it involves altering DNA—which contains the building blocks of the genetic\ncode.\nUsing rDNA technology, scientists can transfer a portion of the DNA from one organism to a single living cell of\nanother. The scientist chemically “snips” the DNA chain of the host cell at a predetermined point and attaches\nanother piece of DNA from a donor cell at that place, creating a completely new organism.\nProponents of rDNA research and development claim that it will allow scientists to find cures for disease and to\nbetter understand how genetic information controls an organism’s development. They also see many other\npotentially practical benefits, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Some corporations employing the new\ntechnology even claim that within a decade or so all major diseases will be treated with drugs derived from\nmicroorganisms created through rDNA technology. Pharmaceutical products already developed, but not yet\nmarketed, indicate that these predictions may be realized.\nProponents also cite nonmedical applications for this technology. Energy production and waste disposal may\nbenefit: genetically altered organisms could convert sewage and other organic material into methane fuel.\nAgriculture might also take advantage of rDNA technology to produce new varieties of crops that resist foul\nweather, pests, and the effects of poor soil.\nA major concern of the critics of rDNA research is that genetically altered microorganisms might escape from the\nlaboratory. Because these microorganisms are laboratory creations that, in all probability, do not occur in nature,\ntheir interaction with the natural world cannot be predicted with certainty. It is possible that they could cause\npreviously unknown perhaps incurable, diseases. The effect of genetically altered microorganisms on the world’s\nmicrobiological predator-prey relationships is another potentially serious problem pointed out by the opponents\nof rDNA research. Introducing a new species may disrupt or even destroy the existing ecosystem. The collapse of\ninterdependent relationships among species, extrapolated to its extreme, could eventually result in the\ndestruction of humanity.\nOpponents of rDNA technology also cite ethical problems with it. For example, it gives scientists the power to\ninstantly cross evolutionary and species boundaries that nature took millennia to establish. The implications of\nsuch power would become particularly profound if genetic engineers were to tinker with human genes, a practice\nthat would bring us one step closer to Aldous Huxley’s grim vision in Brave New World of a totalitarian society\nthat engineers human beings to fulfill specific roles.",

        "passage": "One scientific discipline, during its early stages of development, is often related to another as an antithesis to its\nthesis. The thesis discipline tend to concern itself with discovery and classification of phenomena, to offer holistic\nexplanations emphasizing pattern and form, and to use existing theory to explain the widest possible range of\nphenomena. The paired or antidiscipline, on the other hand, can be characterized by a more focused approach,\nconcentrating on the units of construction, and by a belief that the discipline can be reformulated in terms of the\nissues and explanations of the antidiscipline.\nThe relationship of cytology (cell biology) to biochemistry in the late nineteenth century, when both disciplines\nwere growing at a rapid pace, exemplifies such a pattern. Researchers in cell biology found mounting evidence of\nan intricate cell architecture. They also deduced the mysterious choreography of the chromosomes during cell\ndivision. Many biochemists, on the other hand, remained skeptical of the idea that so much structure existed,\narguing that the chemical reactions that occur in cytological preparations might create the appearance of such\nstructures. Also, they stood apart from the debate then raging over whether protoplasm, the complex of living\nmaterial within a cell, is homogeneous, networklike, granular, or foamlike. Their interest lay in the core\n“fundamental” issues of the chemical nature of protoplasm, especially the newly formulated enzyme theory of\nlife.\nIn general, biochemists judged cytologists to be too ignorant of chemistry to grasp the basic processes, whereas\ncytologists considered the methods of biochemists inadequate to characterize the structures of the living cell. The\nrenewal of Mendelian genetics and, later, progress in chromosome mapping did little at first to effect a synthesis.\nBoth sides were essentially correct. Biochemistry has more than justified its extravagant early claims by explaining\nso much of the cellular machinery. But in achieving this feat (mostly since 1950) it has been partially transformed\ninto the new discipline of molecular biology—biochemistry that deals with spatial arrangements and movements\nof large molecules. At the same time cytology has metamorphosed into modern cellular biology. Aided by\nelectron microscopy, it has become more similar in language and outlook to molecular biology. The interaction of\na discipline and its antidiscipline has moved both sciences toward a synthesis, namely molecular genetics.\nThis interaction between paired disciplines can have important results. In the case of late nineteenth-century cell\nresearch, progress was fueled by competition among the various attitudes and issues derived from cell biology\nand biochemistry. Joseph Fruton, a biochemist, has suggested that such competition and the resulting tensions\namong researchers are a principal source of vitality and “are likely to lead to unexpected and exciting novelties in\nthe future, as they have in the past.”",

Geologists argued that a dramatic drop in sea\nlevel coincided with the extinction of the dinosaurs and could have\ncaused the climatic changes that resulted in this extinction as well\nas the extinction of many ocean species.\nThis view was seriously challenged in the 1980s by the discovery of large amounts of iridium in a layer of clay\ndeposited at the end of the Cretaceous period. Because iridium is extremely rare in rocks on the Earth’s surface\nbut common in meteorites, researchers theorized that it was the impact of a large meteorite that dramatically\nchanged the earth’s climate and thus triggered the extinction of the dinosaurs.\nCurrently available evidence, however, offers more support for a new theory, the volcanic-eruption theory. A vast\neruption of lava in India coincided with the extinctions that occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period, and the\nrelease of carbon dioxide from this episode of volcanism could have caused the climatic change responsible for\nthe demise of the dinosaurs. Such outpourings of lava are caused by instability in the lowest layer of the Earth’s\nmantle, located just above the Earth’s core. As the rock that constitutes this layer is heated by the Earth’s core, it\nbecomes less dense and portions of it eventually escape upward as blobs or molten rock, called “diapirs,” that\ncan, under certain circumstances, erupt violently through the Earth’s crust.\nMoreover, the volcanic-eruption theory, like the impact theory, accounts for the presence of iridium in\nsedimentary deposits; it also explains matters that the meteorite-impact theory does not. Although iridium is\nextremely rare on the Earth’s surface, the lower regions of the Earth’s mantle have roughly the same composition\nas meteorites and contain large amounts of iridium, which in the case of a diapir eruption would probably be\nemitted as iridium hexafluoride, a gas that would disperse more uniformly in the atmosphere than the iridiumcontaining\nmatter thrown out from a meteorite impact. In addition, the volcanic-eruption theory may explain why\nthe end of the Cretaceous period was marked by a gradual change in sea level. Fossil records indicate that for\nseveral hundred thousand years prior to the relatively sudden disappearance of the dinosaurs, the level of the sea\ngradually fell, causing many marine organisms to die out. This change in sea level might well have been the result\nof a distortion in the Earth’s surface that resulted from the movement of diapirs upward toward the Earth’s crust,\nand the more cataclysmic extinction of the dinosaurs could have resulted from the explosive volcanism that\noccurred as material from the diapirs erupted onto the Earth’s surface.",

        "passage": "A major tenet of the neurosciences has been that all neurons (nerve\ncells) in the brains of vertebrate animals are formed early in\ndevelopment. An adult vertebrate, it was believed, must make do\nwith a fixed number of neurons: those lost through disease or injury\nare not replaced, and adult learning takes place not through\ngeneration of new cells but through modification of connections\namong existing ones.\nHowever, new evidence for neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons) has come from the study of canary song.\nYoung canaries and other songbirds learn to sing much as humans learn to speak, by imitating models provided by\ntheir elders. Several weeks after birth, a young bird produces its first rudimentary attempts at singing; over the\nnext few months the song becomes more structured and stable, reaching a fully developed state by the time the\nbird approaches its first breeding season. But this repertoire of song is not permanently learned. After each\nbreeding season, during late summer and fall, the bird loses mastery of its developed “vocabulary,” and its song\nbecomes as unstable as that of a juvenile bird. During the following winter and spring, however, the canary\nacquires new songs, and by the next breeding season it has developed an entirely new repertoire.\nRecent neurological research into this learning and relearning process has shown that the two most important\nregions of the canary’s brain related to the learning of songs actually vary in size at different times of the year. In\nthe spring, when the bird’s song is highly developed and uniform, the regions are roughly twice as large as they\nare in the fall. Further experiments tracing individual nerve cells within these regions have shown that the\nnumber of neurons drops by about 38 percent after the breeding season, but by the following breeding season,\nnew ones have been generated to replace them. A possible explanation for this continual replacement of nerve\ncells may have to do with the canary’s relatively long life span and the requirements of flight. Its brain would have\nto be substantially larger and heavier than might be feasible for flying if it had to carry all the brain cells needed to\nprocess and retain all the information gathered over a lifetime.\nAlthough the idea of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain is still not generally accepted, these findings\nmight help uncover a mechanism that would enable the human brain to repair itself through neurogenesis.\nWhether such replacement of neurons would disrupt complex learning processes or long-term memory is not\nknown, but songbird research challenges scientists to identify the genes or hormones that orchestrate\nneurogenesis in the young human brain and to learn how to activate them in the adult brain.",

        "passage": "In order to explain the socioeconomic achievement, in the face of disadvantages due to racial discrimination, of\nChinese and Japanese immigrants to the United States and their descendants, sociologists have typically applied\neither culturally based or structurally based theories—but never both together. To use an economic metaphor,\nculturally based explanations assert the importance of the supply side of the labor market, emphasizing the\nqualities immigrant groups bring with them for competition in the United States labor market. Such explanations\nreflect a human-capital perspective in which status attainment is seen as a result of individuals’ ability to generate\nresources. Structurally based explanations, on the other hand, examine the market condition of the immigrants’\nhost society, particularly its discriminatory practices and their impact on the status attainment process of\nimmigrant groups. In the economic metaphor, structural explanations assert the importance of the demand side\nof the labor market.\nIn order to understand the socioeconomic mobility of Chinese and Japanese immigrants and their descendants,\nonly an analysis of supply-side and demand-side factors together, in the context of historical events, will suffice.\nOn the cultural or supply side, differences in immigration pattern and family formation resulted in different rates\nof socioeconomic achievement for Chinese and Japanese immigrants. For various reasons, Chinese immigrants\nremained sojourners and did not (except for urban merchants) establish families. They were also hampered by\nethnic conflict in the labor market. Japanese immigrants, on the other hand, were less constrained, made the\ntransition from sojourner to settler within the first two decades of immigration, and left low-wage labor to\nestablish small businesses based on a household mode of production. Chinese sojourners without families were\nmore vulnerable to demoralization, whereas Japanese immigrants faced societal hostility with the emotional\nresources provided by a stable family life. Once Chinese immigrants began to establish nuclear families and\nproduce a second generation, instituting household production similar to that established by Japanese\nimmigrants, their socioeconomic attainment soon paralleled that of Japanese immigrants and their descendants.\nOn the structural or demand side, changes in institutional constraints, immigration laws, labor markets, and\nsocietal hostility were rooted in the dynamics of capitalist economic development. Early capitalist development\ngenerated a demand for low-wage labor that could not be fulfilled. Early Chinese and Japanese immigration was a\nresponse to this demand. In an advanced capitalist economy, the demand for immigrant labor is more\ndifferentiated: skilled professional and technical labor fills empty positions in the primary labor market and, with\nthe traditional unskilled low-wage labor, creates two immigrant streams. The high levels of education attained by\nthe descendants of Chinese and Japanese immigrants and their concentration in strategic states such as California\npaved the way for the movement of the second generation into the expanding primary labor market in the\nadvanced capitalist economy that existed after the Second World War.",

        "passage": "How does the brain know when carbohydrates have been or should be\nconsumed? The answer to this question is not known, but one element in\nthe explanation seems to be the neurotransmitter serotonin, one of a class\nof chemical mediators that may be released from a presynaptic neuron and\nthat cause the transmission of a nerve impulse across a synapse to an\nadjacent postsynaptic neuron. In general, it has been found that drugs that\nselectively facilitate serotonin-mediated neurotransmission tend to cause\nweight loss, whereas drugs that block serotonin-mediated transmission often have the opposite effect: they often\ninduce carbohydrate craving and consequent weight gain.\nSerotonin is a derivative of tryptophan, an amino acid that is normally present at low levels in the bloodstream.\nThe rate of conversion is affected by the proportion of carbohydrates in an individual’s diet: carbohydrates\nstimulate the secretion of insulin, which facilitates the uptake of most amino acids into peripheral tissues, such as\nmuscles. Blood tryptophan levels, however, are unaffected by insulin, so the proportion of tryptophan in the\nblood relative to the other amino acids increases when carbohydrates are consumed. Since tryptophan competes\nwith other amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, insulin secretion indirectly\nspeeds tryptophan’s entry into the central nervous system where, in a special cluster of neurons, it is converted\ninto serotonin.\nThe level of serotonin in the brain in turn affects the amount of carbohydrate an individual chooses to eat. Rats\nthat are allowed to choose among synthetic foods containing different proportions of carbohydrate and protein\nwill normally alternate between foods containing mostly protein and those containing mostly carbohydrate.\nHowever, if rats are given drugs that enhance the effect of serotonin, the rats’ carbohydrate intake is reduced. On\nthe other hand, when rats are given drugs that interrupt serotonin-mediated neurotransmission, their brains fail\nto respond when carbohydrates are eaten, so the desire for them persists.\nIn human beings a serotonin-like drug, d-fenfluramine (which release serotonin into brain synapses and then\nprolong its action by blocking its reabsorption into the presynaptic neuron), selectively suppresses carbohydrate\nsnacking (and its associated weight gain) in people who crave carbohydrates. In contrast, drugs that block\nserotonin-mediated transmission or that interact with neurotransmitters other than serotonin have the opposite\neffect: they often induce carbohydrate craving and subsequent weight gain. People who crave carbohydrates\nreport feeling refreshed and invigorated after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal (which would be expected to\nincrease brain serotonin levels), in contrast, those who do not crave carbohydrates become sleepy following a\nhigh-carbohydrate meal. These findings suggest that serotonin has other effects that may be useful indicators of\nserotonin levels in human beings.",

        "passage": "Anthropologist David Mandelbaum makes a distinction between life-passage\nstudies and life-history studies which emerged primarily out of research\nconcerning Native Americans. Life-passage studies, he says, “emphasize the\nrequirements of society, showing how groups socialize and enculturate their\nyoung in order to make them into viable members of society.” Life histories,\nhowever, “emphasize the experiences and requirements of the individual,\nhow the person copes with society rather than how society copes with the\nstream of individuals.” Life-passage studies bring out the general cultural\ncharacteristics and commonalities that broadly define a culture, but are\nunconcerned with an individual’s choices or how the individual perceives and\nresponds to the demands and expectations imposed by the constraints of his\nor her culture. This distinction can clearly be seen in the autobiographies of\nNative American women.\nFor example, some early recorded autobiographies, such as The Autobiography of a Fox Indian Woman, a life\npassage recorded by anthropologist Truman Michelson, emphasizes prescribed roles. The narrator presents her\nstory in a way that conforms with tribal expectations. Michelson’s work is valuable as ethnography, as a reflection\nof the day-to-day responsibilities of Mesquakie women, yet as is often the case with life-passage studies, it\npresents little of the central character’s psychological motivation. The Fox woman’s life story focuses on her tribal\neducation and integration into the ways of her people, and relates only what Michelson ultimately decided was\nworth preserving. The difference between the two types of studies is often the result of the amount of control\nthe narrator maintains over the material; autobiographies in which there are no recorder-editors are far more\nreflective of the life-history category, for there are no outsiders shaping the story to reflect their preconceived\nnotions of what the general cultural patterns are.\nFor example, in Maria Campbell’s account of growing up as a Canadian Metis who was influenced strongly, and\noften negatively, by the non-Native American world around her, one learns a great deal about the life of Native\nAmerican women, but Campbell’s individual story, which is told to us directly, is always the center of her\nnarrative. Clearly it is important to her to communicate to the audience what her experiences as a Native\nAmerican have been. Through Campbell’s story of her family the reader learns of the effect of poverty and\nprejudice on a people. The reader becomes an intimate of Campbell the writer, sharing her pain and celebrating\nher small victories. Although Campbell’s book is written as a life history (the dramatic moments, the frustrations,\nand the fears are clearly hers), it reveals much about ethnic relations in Canada while reflecting the period in\nwhich it was written.",

        "passage": "Although bacteria are unicellular and among the simplest autonomous\nforms of life, they show a remarkable ability to sense their\nenvironment. They are attracted to materials they need and are\nrepelled by harmful substances. Most types of bacteria swim very\nerratically: short smooth runs in relatively straight lines are followed by\nbrief tumbles, after which the bacteria shoot off in random directions.\nThis leaves researchers with the question of how such bacteria find\ntheir way to an attractant such as food or, in the case of photosynthetic\nbacteria, light, if their swimming pattern consists only of smooth runs\nand tumbles, the latter resulting in random changes in direction.\nOne clue comes from the observation that when a chemical attractant is added to a suspension of such bacteria,\nthe bacteria swim along a gradient of the attractant, from an area where the concentration of the attractant is\nweaker to an area where it is stronger. As they do so, their swimming is characterized by a decrease in tumbling\nand an increase in straight runs over relatively longer distances. As the bacteria encounter increasing\nconcentrations of the attractant, their tendency to tumble is suppressed, whereas tumbling increases whenever\nthey move away from the attractant. The net effect is that runs in the direction of higher concentrations of the\nattractant become longer and straighter as a result of the suppression of tumbling, whereas runs away from it are\nshortened by an increased tendency of the bacteria to tumble and change direction.\nBiologists have proposed two mechanisms that bacteria might use in detecting changes in the concentration of a\nchemical attractant. First, a bacterium might compare the concentration of a chemical at the front and back of its\ncell body simultaneously. If the concentration is higher at the front of the cell, then it knows it is moving up the\nconcentration gradient, from an area where the concentration is lower to an area where it is higher. Alternatively,\nit might measure the concentration at one instant and again after a brief interval, in which case the bacterium\nmust retain a memory of the initial concentration. Researchers reasoned that if bacteria do compare\nconcentrations at different times, then when suddenly exposed to a uniformly high concentration of an\nattractant, the cells would behave as if they were swimming up a concentration gradient, with long, smooth runs\nand relatively few tumbles. If, on the other hand, bacteria detect a chemical gradient by measuring it\nsimultaneously at two distinct points, front and back, on the cell body, they would not respond to the jump in\nconcentration because the concentration of the attractant in front and back of the cells, though high, would be\nuniform. Experimental evidence suggests that bacteria compare concentrations at different times.",

        "passage": "The human species came into being at the time of the greatest\nbiological diversity in the history of the Earth. Today, as human\npopulations expand and alter the natural environment, they are\nreducing biological diversity to its lowest level since the end of\nthe Mesozoic era, 65 million years ago. The ultimate\nconsequences of this biological collision are beyond calculation,\nbut they are certain to be harmful. That, in essence, is the\nbiodiversity crisis.\nThe history of global diversity can be summarized as follows: after the initial flowering of multicellular animals,\nthere was a swift rise in the number of species in early Paleozoic times (between 600 and 430 million years ago),\nthen plateaulike stagnation for the remaining 200 million years of the Paleozoic era, and finally a slow but steady\nclimb through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras to diversity’s all-time high. This history suggests that biological\ndiversity was hard won and a long time in coming. Furthermore, this pattern of increase was set back by five\nmassive extinction episodes. The most recent of these, during the Cretaceous period, is by far the most famous,\nbecause it ended the age of the dinosaurs, conferred hegemony on the mammals, and ultimately made possible\nthe ascendancy of the human species. But the cretaceous crisis was minor compared with the Permian\nextinctions 240 million years ago, during which between 77 and 96 percent of marine animal species perished. It\ntook 5 million years, well into Mesozoic times, for species diversity to begin a significant recovery.\nWithin the past 10,000 years biological diversity has entered a wholly new era. Human activity has had a\ndevastating effect on species diversity, and the rate of human-induced extinctions is accelerating. Half of the bird\nspecies of Polynesia have been eliminated through hunting and the destruction of native forests. Hundreds of fish\nspecies endemic to Lake Victoria are now threatened with extinction following the careless introduction of one\nspecies of fish, the Nile perch. The list of such biogeographic disasters is extensive.\nBecause every species is unique and irreplaceable, the loss of biodiversity is the most profound process of\nenvironmental change. Its consequences are also the least predictable because the value of Earth’s biota (the\nfauna and flora collectively) remains largely unstudied and unappreciated; unlike material and cultural wealth,\nwhich we understand because they are the substance of our everyday lives, biological wealth is usually taken for\ngranted. This is a serious strategic error, one that will be increasingly regretted as time passes. The biota is not\nonly part of a country’s heritage, the product of millions of years of evolution centered on that place; it is also a\npotential source for immense untapped material wealth in the form of food, medicine, and other commercially\nimportant substance.",

        "passage": "Before Laura Gilpin (1891-1979), few women in the history of\nphotography had so devoted themselves to chronicling the landscape.\nOther women had photographed the land, but none can be regarded\nas a landscape photographer with a sustained body of work\ndocumenting the physical terrain. Anne Brigman often photographed\nwoodlands and coastal areas, but they were generally settings for her\nartfully placed subjects. Dorothea Lange’s landscapes were always\nconceived of as counterparts to her portraits of rural women.\nAt the same time that Gilpin’s interest in landscape work distinguished her from most other women\nphotographers, her approach to landscape photography set her apart from men photographers who, like Gilpin,\ndocumented the western United States. Western American landscape photography grew out of a male tradition,\npioneered by photographers attached to government and commercial survey teams that went west in the 1860’s\nand 1870’s. These explorer-photographers documented the West that their employers wanted to see: an exotic\nand majestic land shaped by awesome natural forces, unpopulated and ready for American settlement. The next\ngeneration of male photographers, represented by Ansel Adams and Eliot Porter, often worked with\nconservationist groups rather than government agencies or commercial companies, but they nonetheless\npreserved the “heroic” style and maintained the role of respectful outsider peering in with reverence at a fragile\nnatural world.\nFor Gilpin, by contrast, the landscape was neither an empty vista awaiting human settlement nor a jewel-like\nscene resisting human intrusion, but a peopled landscape with a rich history and tradition of its own, an\nenvironment that shaped and molded the lives of its inhabitants. Her photographs of the Rio Grande, for\nexample, consistently depict the river in terms of its significance to human culture: as a source of irrigation water,\na source of food for livestock, and a provider of town sites. Also instructive is Gilpin’s general avoidance of\nextreme close-ups of her natural subjects: for her, emblematic details could never suggest the intricacies of the\ninterrelationship between people and nature that made the landscape a compelling subject. While it is dangerous\nto draw conclusions about a “feminine” way of seeing from the work of one woman, it can nonetheless be argued\nthat Gilpin’s unique approach to landscape photography was analogous to the work of many women writers who,\nfar more than their male counterparts, described the landscape in terms of its potential to sustain human life.\nGilpin never spoke of herself as a photographer with a feminine perspective: she eschewed any discussion of\ngender as it related to her work and maintained little interest in interpretations that relied on the concept of a\n“woman’s eye.” Thus it is ironic that her photographic evocation of a historical landscape should so clearly\npresent a distinctively feminine approach to landscape photography.",

        "passage": "As people age, their cells become less efficient and less able to replace damaged components. At the same time\ntheir tissues stiffen. For example, the lungs and the heart muscle expand less successfully, the blood vessels\nbecome increasingly rigid, and the ligaments and tendons tighten. Few investigators would attribute such diverse\neffects to a single cause. Nevertheless, researchers have discovered that a process long known to discolor and\ntoughen foods may also contribute to age-related impairment of both cells and tissues. That process is\nnonenzymatic glycosylation, whereby glucose becomes attached to proteins without the aid of enzymes. When\nenzymes attach glucose to proteins (enzymatic glycosylation), they do so at a specific site on a specific protein\nmolecule for a specific purpose. In contrast, the nonenzymatic process adds glucose haphazardly to any of several\nsites along any available peptide chain within a protein molecule.\nThis nonenzymatic glycosylation of certain proteins has been understood by food chemists for decades, although\nfew biologists recognized until recently that the same steps could take place in the body. Nonenzymatic\nglycosylation begins when an aldehyde group (CHO) of glucose and an amino group (NH2) of a protein are\nattracted to each other. The molecules combine, forming what is called a Schiff base within the protein. This\ncombination is unstable and quickly rearranges itself into a stabler, but still reversible, substance known as an\nAmadori product.\nIf a given protein persists in the body for months or years, some of its Amadori products slowly dehydrate and\nrearrange themselves yet again, into new glucose-derived structures. These can combine with various kinds of\nmolecules to form irreversible structures named advanced glycosylation end products (AGE’s). Most AGE’s are\nyellowish brown and fluorescent and have specific spectrographic properties. More important for the body, many\nare also able to cross-link adjacent proteins, particularly ones that give structure to tissues and organs. Although\nno one has yet satisfactorily described the origin of all such bridges between proteins, many investigators agree\nthat extensive cross-linking of proteins probably contributes to the stiffening and loss of elasticity characteristic of\naging tissues.\nIn an attempt to link this process with the development of cataracts (the browning and clouding of the lens of the\neye as people age), researchers studied the effect of glucose on solutions of purified crystallin, the major protein\nin the lens of the eye. Glucose-free solutions remained clear, but solutions with glucose caused the proteins to\nform clusters, suggesting that the molecules had become cross-linked. The clusters diffracted light, making the\nsolution opaque. The researchers also discovered that the pigmented cross-links in human cataracts have the\nbrownish color and fluorescence characteristic of AGE’s. These data suggest that nonenzymatic glycosylation of\nlens crystallins may contribute to cataract formation.",

        "passage": "Among the myths taken as fact by the environmental managers of most corporations is the belief that environmental regulations affect all competitors in a given industry uniformly. In reality, regulatory costs—and therefore compliance—fall unevenly, economically disadvantaging some companies and benefiting others. For example, a plant situated near a number of larger non-compliant competitors is less likely to attract the attention of local regulators than is an isolated plant, and less attention means lower costs. Additionally, large plants can spread compliance costs such as waste treatment across a larger revenue base; on the other hand, some smaller plants may not even be subject to certain provisions such as permit or reporting requirements by virtue of their size. Finally, older production technologies often continue to generate toxic wastes that were not regulated when the technology was first adopted. New regulations have imposed extensive compliance costs on companies still using older industrial coal-fired burners that generate high sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs, for example, whereas new facilities generally avoid processes that would create such waste products. By realizing that they have discretion and that not all industries are affected equally by environmental regulation, environmental managers can help their companies to achieve a competitive edge by anticipating regulatory pressure and exploring all possibilities for addressing how changing regulations will affect their companies specifically.",

        "passage": "Frequently it is advantageous to businesses to offer a group of products or services as a package, or \"bundle.\" Bundles of existing products act like new products in the marketplace but typically are less expensive and risky to create and require less time to introduce. Aggregation bundling is a market-expanding strategy that involves creating a bundle that will appeal to numerous customer segments, albeit for different reasons; the goal is to reach a large market and reduce complexity by marketing fewer separate products. For example, a credit card may include a wide variety of services, such as car rental insurance and a purchase protection plan. Even though it is unlikely that large numbers of subscribers are interested in all the available services, they all use the same card. Loyalty bundling is another such strategy, where the goal is to expand sales by reducing a customer's incentive to sample and perhaps switch to a competitor's product. For example, a cereal company sometimes offers \"variety packs,\" each with several different brands of that company's cereal. But whatever the bundling strategy, manufacturers must be careful to offer bundles whose value is perceived as greater than the sum of the individual components, to avoid the impression that portions of the bundle are wasteful. Additionally, manufacturers often benefit from continuing to offer specialized products separately (at a relatively higher price) to attract certain customers.",

        "passage": "That lunar craters are not distributed evenly over the lunar surface is immediately obvious with even a small telescope. Craters also appear in a wide range of sizes from only a few meters across to hundreds of kilometers in diameter. The maria (the very large plains) are noticeably devoid of large craters. Any explanation of crater formation must clearly take these facts into account. There are two main theories concerning the origin of the lunar craters: one is that they were formed by the impact of meteorites, the other that they are due to some type of volcanic activity. According to the former theory, the large majority of the craters were formed during the early stages of the Moon's development when, as seems possible, the number of meteoritic bodies moving in orbits similar to that of the Earth-Moon system was quite large. Since the Moon, unlike the Earth, possesses no atmosphere, such bodies would reach the lunar surface at a higher velocity than they would reach Earth. They also would not be affected by frictional burning such as they would undergo when plunging through the terrestrial atmosphere. When a large body strikes the lunar surface, it is not stopped at the moment of impact but penetrates to a depth that depends on its mass, radius, and impact velocity. If we are to explain the very large craters on the assumption that several meteorites fell close together (in space, although not necessarily in time), this would imply that such craters should have uneven floors, not only indented to varying degrees by the several impacts but strewn with boulders and debris from the breakup of the meteorites themselves. Observation, however, suggests that the floors of large craters are smoother than can be accounted for by this theory unless there is some other mechanism whereby the floor becomes appreciably smoother following the impact. One mechanism that has been suggested is that those meteorites that formed the craters fell on the lunar surface when the Moon was in a semi plastic condition or, if they fell after the lunar crust had solidified, that the impact itself would liquefy the surface rock sufficiently to force it to flow rather like lava. This liquefying of the rock at the moment of impact has also been put forward to explain the presence in some craters of a central mountain peak since we know, from high-speed photography of drops falling into liquids that a jet is formed in the center of an impact region. There is unfortunately, one very serious objection to this idea. When a body the size and shape of a meteorite strikes solid rock it is quite probable that no intermediate liquid phase of the surface rock is ever produced.",

        "passage": "Even though physiological and behavioral processes are maximized within relatively narrow ranges of temperatures in amphibians and reptiles, individuals may not maintain activity at the optimum temperatures for performance because of the costs associated with doing so. Alternatively, activity can occur at suboptimal temperatures even when the costs are great. Theoretically, costs of activity at suboptimal temperatures must be balanced by gains of being active. For instance, the leatherback sea turtle will hunt during the time of day in which krill are abundant, even though the water is cooler and thus the turtle’s body temperature requires greater metabolic activity. In general, however, the cost of keeping a suboptimal body temperature, for reptiles and amphibians, is varied and not well understood; they include risk of predation, reduced performance, and reduced foraging success. One reptile that scientists understand better is the desert lizard, which is active during the morning at relatively low body temperatures (usually 33.0 C), inactive during midday when external temperatures are extreme, and active in the evening at body temperatures of 37.0 C. Although the lizards engage in similar behavior (e.g., in morning and afternoon, social displays, movements, and feeding), metabolic rates and water loss are great and sprint speed is lower in the evening when body temperatures are high. Thus, the highest metabolic and performance costs of activity occur in the evening when lizards have high body temperatures. However, males that are active late in the day apparently have a higher mating success resulting from their prolonged social encounters. The costs of activity at temperatures beyond those optimal for performance are offset by the advantages gained by maximizing social interactions that ultimately impact individual fitness.",

        "passage": "Researchers have been studying the skeletal remains of a mastodon excavated from the Overmyer farm in Indiana in the United States. Previously, scientists claimed that mastodons whose remains were discovered in former wetland environments, like the Overmyer site, had drowned after breaking through a quaking bog-a pond covered by a mat of floating vegetation. This site's sedimentary evidence, however, indicates that the area had been a small open-water pond at the time the mastodon died. Another common claim is that mastodons died after becoming mired in swamps. The wet areas that mastodons frequented may have provided abundant opportunities to become irretrievably stuck, but an animal adapted for feeding in wetlands generally should be able to avoid such a fate. Furthermore, based on the depth and distribution of its remains, the Overmyer mastodon's hind leg would have been mired in about forty-seven centimeters of pond mud, or less than halfway up its lower leg. A healthy animal would plausibly have to sink much further than mid-shin to become irretrievably stuck. And, if the mastodon had become mired, more of its bones would have been buried and preserved in closer association with each other. The researchers concluded that the bones may have gradually come loose and sunk to the bottom of the pond from the floating carcass as it decomposed.¬",

        "passage": "Protein synthesis begins when the gene encoding a protein is activated. The gene’s sequence of nucleotides is transcribed into a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA), which reproduces the information contained in that sequence. Transported outside the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the mRNA is translated into the protein it encodes by an organelle known as a ribosome, which strings together amino acids in the order specified by the sequence of elements in the mRNA molecule. Since the amount of mRNA in a cell determines the amount of the corresponding protein, factors affecting the abundance of mRNA’s play a major part in the normal functioning of a cell by appropriately regulating protein synthesis. For example, an excess of certain proteins can cause cells to proliferate abnormally and become cancerous; a lack of the protein insulin results in diabetes. Biologists once assumed that the variable rates at which cells synthesize different mRNA’s determine the quantities of mRNA’s and their corresponding proteins in a cell. However, recent investigations have shown that the concentrations of most mRNA’s correlate best, not with their synthesis rate, but rather with the equally variable rates at which cells degrade the different mRNA’s in their cytoplasm. If a cell degrades both a rapidly and a slowly synthesized mRNA slowly, both mRNA’s will accumulate to high levels. An important example of this phenomenon is the development of red blood cells from their unspecialized parent cells in bone marrow. For red blood cells to accumulate sufficient concentrations of hemoglobin (which transports oxygen) to carry out their main function, the cells’ parent cells must simultaneously produce more of the constituent proteins of hemoglobin and less of most other proteins. To do this, the parent cells halt synthesis of non-hemoglobin mRNA’s in the nucleus and rapidly degrade copies of the non-hemoglobin mRNA’s remaining in the cytoplasm. Halting synthesis of mRNA alone would not affect the quantities of proteins synthesized by the mRNA’s still existing in the cytoplasm. Biologists now believe that most cells can regulate protein production most efficiently by varying both mRNA synthesis and degradation, as developing red cells do, rather than by just varying one or the other.",

        "passage": "In terrestrial environments, gravity places special demands on the cardiovascular systems of animals. Gravitational pressure can cause blood to pool in the lower regions of the body, making it difficult to circulate blood to critical organs such as the brain. Terrestrial snakes, in particular, exhibit adaptations that aid in circulating blood against the force of gravity. The problem confronting terrestrial snakes is best illustrated by what happens to sea snakes when removed from their supportive medium. Because the vertical pressure gradients within the blood vessels are counteracted by similar pressure gradients in the surrounding water, the distribution of blood throughout the body of sea snakes remains about the same regardless of their orientation in space, provided they remain in the ocean. When removed from the water and tilted at various angles with the head up, however, blood pressure at their midpoint drops significantly, and at brain level falls to zero. That many terrestrial snakes in similar spatial orientations do not experience this kind of circulatory failure suggests that certain adaptations enable them to regulate blood pressure more effectively in those orientations. One such adaptation is the closer proximity of the terrestrial snake's heart to its head, which helps to ensure circulation to the brain, regardless of the snake's orientation in space. The heart of sea snakes can be located near the middle of the body, a position that minimizes the work entailed in circulating blood to both extremities. In arboreal snakes, however, which dwell in trees and often assume a vertical posture, the average distance from the heart to the head can be as little as 15 percent of overall body length. Such a location requires that blood circulated to the tail of the snake travel a greater distance back to the heart, a problem solved by another adaptation. When climbing, arboreal snakes often pause momentarily to wiggle their bodies, causing waves of muscle contraction that advance from the lower torso to the head. By compressing the veins and forcing blood forward, these contractions apparently improve the flow of venous blood returning to the heart.",

        "passage": "Coral reefs are one of the most fragile, biologically complex, and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth. This ecosystem is one of the fascinating paradoxes of the biosphere: how do clear, and thus nutrient-poor, waters support such prolific and productive communities? Part of the answer lies within the tissues of the corals themselves. Symbiotic cells of algae known as zooxanthellae carry out photosynthesis using the metabolic wastes of the coral thereby producing food for themselves, for their corals, hosts, and even for other members of the reef community. This symbiotic process allows organisms in the reef community to use sparse nutrient resources efficiently. Unfortunately for coral reefs, however, a variety of human activities are causing worldwide degradation of shallow marine habitats by adding nutrients to the water. Agriculture, slash-and-burn land clearing, sewage disposal and manufacturing that creates waste by-products all increase nutrient loads in these waters. Typical symptoms of reef decline are destabilized herbivore populations and an increasing abundance of algae and filter-feeding animals. Declines in reef communities are consistent with observations that nutrient input is increasing in direct proportion to growing human populations, thereby threatening reef communities sensitive to subtle changes in nutrient input to their waters.",

        "passage": "Scientists long believed that two nerve clusters in the human hypothalamus, called suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCNs), were what controlled our circadian rhythms. Those rhythms are the biological cycles that recur approximately every 24 hours in synchronization with the cycle of sunlight and darkness caused by Earth’s rotation. Studies have demonstrated that in some animals, the SCNs control daily fluctuations in blood pressure, body temperature, activity level, and alertness, as well as the nighttime release of the sleep-promoting agent melatonin. Furthermore, cells in the human retina dedicated to transmitting information about light level to the SCNs have recently been discovered. Four critical genes governing circadian cycles have been found to be active in every tissue, however, not just the SCNs, of flies, mice, and humans. In addition, when laboratory rats that usually ate at will were fed only once a day, peak activity of a clock gene in their livers shifted by 12 hours, whereas the same clock gene in the SCNs remained synchronized with light cycles. While scientists do not dispute the role of the SCNs in controlling core functions such as the regulation of body temperature and blood pressure, scientists now believe that circadian clocks in other organs and tissues may respond to external cues other than light—including temperature changes—that recur regularly 24 hours.",

        "passage": "Most women still work in female-dominated jobs and at lower wages than men typically earn. This phenomenon puzzles supply-side economists, who believe that the demands of the marketplace and the play of self-interest dictate that all inequities in economic status engendered by discrimination must eventually disappear. One of their number, Solomon Polachek, has recently proposed a supply-side explanation for job segregation by gender that emphasizes the depreciation of human capital while one is on leave from work. This theory posits that human beings are a form of capital: investments (such as education or job experience) increase market value and depreciation (such as unemployment or voluntary absence from work) decreases market value. Polachek argues, on the basis of this theory, that wage depreciation occurs if a person has lower real wages upon returning to employment than he or she had on quitting. In addition, Polachek asserts that some occupations entail greater risks of wage depreciation than others and that women, who are much more likely than men to plan intermittent full-time employment, may choose occupations with low depreciation penalties in order to maximize lifetime earnings. Since most men, on the other hand, plan continuous full-time employment, they can afford to choose occupations that demand consistent maintenance and improvement of skills. Thus, according to Polachek, differences in employment continuity lead to gender differences in the jobs chosen to maximize lifetime earnings, and hence gender segregation in the workplace is a product of rational pecuniary choices made by male and female workers. Polachek’s thesis, though quite sophisticated, is not supported by empirical evidence. Contrary to Polachek’s prediction, women in predominantly male occupations suffer the same wage depreciation rates as women in predominantly female occupations. These findings tell us that for women the depreciation penalty—the amount by which real wages drop during periods away from employment—is no lower in female- than in male-dominated jobs. Nor, as some other economists have proposed, do female-dominated jobs have higher entry-level salaries, though much lower wage-appreciation rates, than male-dominated jobs. Thus, there is no economic advantage to women in choosing female-dominated jobs.",
